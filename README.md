**MEAN Stack Backend Microservices using Express.js - README**

Welcome to the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) Stack Backend Microservices application!

## 1. Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a MEAN stack application with a microservices architecture on the backend. The MEAN stack is a popular choice for building web applications as it leverages the power of JavaScript throughout the entire development stack. In this project, we focus on breaking down the backend into smaller, independent microservices to achieve better scalability and maintainability.

## 2. Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- Express.js: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- Docker: Containerization platform for packaging microservices.
- Other dependencies can be found in the `package.json` files in the respective microservices.


## 4. Installation

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mean-backend-microservices.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd healthCare-MicroServices`
3. `./start_microservices.sh`
4. 
## 6. Microservices Architecture

The microservices architecture in this project focuses on breaking down the backend into smaller, loosely coupled services. Each microservice is responsible for specific tasks, such as user authentication, data retrieval, data manipulation, etc. The communication between microservices can be done through RESTful APIs or message queues, depending on the application's requirements.
